### Hi there 👋

My name is Willian Conceição Queiroz, and I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). 
- 👨‍🎓 I'm a student of Computer Science at the Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm learning the Spring Framework for developing REST applications, as well as exploring other interesting topics like Lua, and trying my hand at some front-end projects with Angular.

Text improved, I hope, by ChatGPT 🤖.
